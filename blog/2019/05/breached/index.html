I decided a) that I would kind of like the special edition ThinkPad he was giving away, and b) that I could probably whip something up pretty quickly.</p><p>I decided to create a browser extension that would simply pull HIBP breach information and show a browser notification &ndash; with the ability to view extra info &ndash; when the user visited a site that had been breached. And so was born the <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/breached>Breached extension</a>. (Spoiler: I didn&rsquo;t win.)</p><blockquote><p>For non-technical readers: A &ldquo;breach&rdquo;, in this context, is when a hacker obtains the user database of a website. A breach generally includes email addresses, passwords (in some form), maybe credit cards, and other stuff you don&rsquo;t want a hacker to have. So &ldquo;breach information&rdquo; about a website tells you that a breach occurred, when it happened, what data was stolen, and how much of it. Which is the kind of thing you should know about before using that website!</p></blockquote><p>A month after I released the extension, someone created an issue pointing out that Mozilla <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/breached/issues/5>&ldquo;started working on integrating haveibeenpwned.com warnings into Firefox&rdquo;</a>. (As I promised there I did (nominally) reach out, but it didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.) A year later that project turned into <a href=https://monitor.firefox.com/>Firefox Monitor</a>.</p><p>So, Breached is basically redundant on Firefox. In a sense I&rsquo;m bummed, but I&rsquo;m more flattered &ndash; it was obviously a pretty okay idea!</p><p>Monitor has a different <a href=https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/11/14/when-does-firefox-alert-for-breached-sites/>notification policy</a>: They only show alerts for sites that have been breached within the last two months. (If I&rsquo;m reading that right. I think the 12-month part is a one-off and is likely just to increase the number of people that will ever see a notification). Breached&rsquo;s policy is&mldr; just, like, show them all. Because I didn&rsquo;t think about that while coding it. I think Monitor&rsquo;s time-limit is better, since many sites will have sorted themselves out and don&rsquo;t deserve a black mark for all time, so I <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/breached/issues/6>might also add a time limit</a>. (I don&rsquo;t find the notifications noisy, but maybe I just don&rsquo;t visit enough shady sites.)</p><p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering what Monitor notifications look like, here&rsquo;s one:</p><p class=text-center><img src=../../../../img/blog/firefox-monitor-breach.png alt="Firefox Monitor breach notification" style=max-width:600px></p><p>And here is Breached&rsquo;s notification:</p><p class=text-center><img src=../../../../img/blog/breached-notification.png alt="Breached's breach notification" style=max-width:400px></p><p>And the additional-detail popup:</p><p class=text-center><img src=../../../../img/blog/breached-popup.png alt="Breached's additional detail popup"></p><p>Well, at least Breached is still relevant on Chrome!

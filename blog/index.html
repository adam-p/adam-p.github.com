<h4><a href=../blog/2022/01/golang-http-server-timeouts/>Diving into Go's HTTP server</a></h4>
<div>
2022-01-15
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
Recently, I was adding timeouts to a Go HTTP server and ended up exploring how the different settings and approaches act and interact. I&rsquo;m going to publish my notes here, along with the code I used for testing. Hopefully this will help someone else (or myself) in the future.
The timeout testing client can be found here: github.com/adam-p/httptimeout. There is a server in the examples directory that you can make requests to.

<div>
2021-11-28
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
How should travel time be estimated? What are the ethical implications of the approach taken?
You enter your destination into your maps app. It finds a few likely routes. It determines the distance of each pretty easily. It checks traffic conditions along the routes. But we don&rsquo;t yet have a travel time estimate. Time equals distance divided by speed, adjusted for traffic.
What travel speed (traffic notwithstanding) does the app use?

<h4><a href=../blog/2021/11/constant-time-network/>Timing attack mitigation must exclude network</a></h4>
<div>
2021-11-27
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
TL;DR: When trying to prevent timing attacks (e.g., against login username enumeration) by making a request take constant time, make sure you exclude the network read and write time. If you don&rsquo;t, an attacker can slow down their request to bypass it.
I&rsquo;ll be covering some background and contextual information here. If you don&rsquo;t need it, skip to &ldquo;Exclude network time from constant-time limiting&rdquo;.
What is a &ldquo;timing attack&rdquo;? Briefly, a timing attack (in this context) is when an attacker observes the time it takes for a server to handle a request to glean some information about the validity of the input they tried.

<div>
2021-06-25
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
For four years I carried a Yubikey NEO (USB Type-A) in my pocket, on my keychain. And then it died (would no longer be recognized by any computer).
Yubikey&rsquo;s durability claim was:
Crush-resistant and waterproof, YubiKey NEO is practically indestructible during normal use, weighs only 3g, and attaches to your keychain alongside your house and car keys
So, they didn&rsquo;t explicitly say &ldquo;carrying it on your keychain won&rsquo;t kill it&rdquo;, but they sure did imply it.

I have enjoyed reading other people&rsquo;s design and debugging train-of-thought posts, so after I spent two days wrestling with a code problem, I thought I&rsquo;d write it up. It&rsquo;s not technically exciting, but I think that describing it might be useful to someone &ndash; or my future self &ndash; someday. Or, at the very least, a little amusing.
(Bonus: While writing this I discovered an error I made while doing the actual work.

In October 2017, Troy Hunt of Have I Been Pwned held a contest inviting people to do something cool with the HIBP API. I decided a) that I would kind of like the special edition ThinkPad he was giving away, and b) that I could probably whip something up pretty quickly.
I decided to create a browser extension that would simply pull HIBP breach information and show a browser notification &ndash; with the ability to view extra info &ndash; when the user visited a site that had been breached.

<div class=post-body>
<div>
[This started as notes to myself to help clarify the problem and solution. It&rsquo;s probably more suited to a Github issue than a blog post, and it may get copied into one.]
The story so far The Firefox and Thunderbird versions of Markdown Here both used nearly the same code &ndash; an old-style XUL extension. Tb is only capable of using a XUL extension, while Fx supports at least three extension types: XUL-based, Add-on SDK (aka Jetpack, aka jpm), and WebExtensions.

<h4><a href=../blog/2016/05/smart-lock-mock-location/>Android Non-Vulnerability: Steal a Device and Keep it Unlocked</a></h4>
<div>
2016-05-11
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
While poking around in my Android phone&rsquo;s developer options, I realized that if you steal a phone that&rsquo;s currently unlocked because it&rsquo;s in a &ldquo;trusted place&rdquo;, then you can force it to remain unlocked forever. (And then I got schooled about that not being a problem.)
Security Feature: Smart Lock with Trusted Places Android&rsquo;s Smart Lock allows users to configure conditions under which to keep the phone unlocked. One of the conditions is location &ndash; you can set trusted locations where your phone shouldn&rsquo;t prompt for a PIN/pattern/password when unlocking.

2015-02-17

<div class=post-body>
<div>
Background and Motivation I received a pull request for Markdown Here that was great: it found a bug, fixed it, and included tests for the fix. However, the PR submitter didn&rsquo;t write the tests using the existing framework, so I figured I&rsquo;d massage his test code into the proper form.
And then I noticed that he included a copyright line in the test file. It says &ldquo;MIT License&rdquo;, which is the license used for the rest of the project, but that got me thinking about what that might mean&mldr;

2013-10-18
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
This is just a stub test post to allow me to try out Markdown Here in Disqus comments.
Right now MDH won&rsquo;t work with Disqus in Chrome because of cross-origin restrictions. See: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/124
Update: The Disqus edit box is contenteditable, and MDH will render in it, but all formatting seems to get stripped out when you actually post the comment. Seems like the rich-edit-ness is probably just to support Disqus&rsquo;s add-an-image feature.

<div class=post-body>
<div>
Trying to get Markdown Here listed in the Safari Extensions Gallery is by far the worst browser extension &ldquo;store&rdquo; experience I&rsquo;ve had so far. Shockingly bad.
No hosting First of all, but least of all: There&rsquo;s no hosting. Unlike the Chrome and Mozilla stores, the Safari store doesn&rsquo;t host the extension for you &ndash; it&rsquo;s really more of a listing of links to wherever you host your extension files. That&rsquo;s not terrible, but:

<h4><a href=../blog/2013/03/pageaction-interaction/>No One Knows to Click on a Page Action</a></h4>
<div>
2013-03-24
</div>
<div class=post-body>
<div>
Page actions &ndash; the buttons in a browser&rsquo;s address bar &ndash; are a surprising UI failure.
When adding a button for a browser extension, a choice must be made whether to make it a &ldquo;page action&rdquo; or a &ldquo;browser action&rdquo; (button on the toolbar). But browsers have failed to communicate the interactiveness of page actions, and almost no one &ndash; techy or layman &ndash; realizes that they&rsquo;re clickable.
To complement the context menu item and hotkey, and to fulfil a user feature request, I decided to add a button to the Markdown Here browser extension.

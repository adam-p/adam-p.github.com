This is just a stub test post to allow me to try out Markdown Here in Disqus comments.

Right now MDH won't work with Disqus in Chrome because of cross-origin restrictions. See: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/124](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/124)

**Update**: The Disqus edit box is `contenteditable`, and MDH will render in it, but all formatting seems to get stripped out when you actually post the comment. Seems like the rich-edit-ness is probably just to support Disqus's add-an-image feature.

In October 2017, Troy Hunt of [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) held a [contest](https://www.troyhunt.com/do-something-awesome-with-have-i-been-pwned-and-win-a-lenovo-thinkpad/) inviting people to do something cool with the HIBP API. I decided a) that I would kind of like the special edition ThinkPad he was giving away, and b) that I could probably whip something up pretty quickly.

I decided to create a browser extension that would simply pull HIBP breach information and show a browser notification -- with the ability to view extra info -- when the user visited a site that had been breached. And so was born the [Breached extension](https://github.com/adam-p/breached). (Spoiler: I didn't win.)

A month after I released the extension, someone created an issue pointing out that Mozilla ["started working on integrating haveibeenpwned.com warnings into Firefox"](https://github.com/adam-p/breached/issues/5). (As I promised there I did (nominally) reach out, but it didn't go anywhere.) A year later that project turned into [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/).

So, Breached is basically redundant on Firefox. In a sense I'm bummed, but I'm more flattered -- it was obviously a pretty okay idea!

Monitor has a different [notification policy](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/11/14/when-does-firefox-alert-for-breached-sites/): They only show alerts for sites that have been breached within the last two months. (If I'm reading that right. I think the 12-month part is a one-off and is likely just to increase the number of people that will ever see a notification). Breached's policy is... just, like, show them all. Because I didn't think about that while coding it. I think Monitor's time-limit is better, since many sites will have sorted themselves out and don't deserve a black mark for all time, so I [might also add a time limit](https://github.com/adam-p/breached/issues/6). (I don't find the notifications noisy, but maybe I just don't visit enough shady sites.)

In case you're wondering what Monitor notifications look like, here's one:

And here is Breached's notification:

And the additional-detail popup:

Well, at least Breached is still relevant on Chrome! For now...

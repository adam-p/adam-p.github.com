</a>Background and Motivation</h2><p>I received a <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/pull/232>pull request</a> for Markdown Here that was great: it found a bug, fixed it, and included tests for the fix. However, the PR submitter didn&rsquo;t write the tests using the existing framework, so I figured I&rsquo;d massage his test code into the proper form.</p><p>And then I noticed that he included a <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/commit/52cd013413ff4645ed124cef68b5fc9044d65a96#diff-555e8e637d661924e36cdddfba81a23aR9>copyright line</a> in the test file. It says &ldquo;MIT License&rdquo;, which is the license used for the rest of the project, but that got me thinking about what that might mean&mldr;</p><p>Wikipedia suggests that the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>MIT License</a> would require me to include his copyright+license notice wherever I use his code. Not a big deal, but annoying. And maybe a slippery slope &ndash; what if I get a bunch more code submissions?</p><p>So I did some research into &ldquo;Contributor License Agreements&rdquo; and found that there are a couple more things to be concerned about:</p><p>If you ever want to change the project license, you have to get the agreement of all contributors. That includes dual-licensing. Good info about that (and CLAs in general), with specific KDE example: <a href=https://julien.ponge.org/blog/in-defense-of-contributor-license-agreements/>&ldquo;In Defense of License Agreements&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>Patent something something. Contributors retain the patent rights unless explicitly granted in the CLA.</p><p>And just to be clear: Contributors have the copyright on their code <em>by default</em>, regardless of whether they put the © notice on it. I&rsquo;m not sure about the license.</p><p>So I decided to require MDH contributors to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; a CLA. Seemed kind of irresponsible not to.</p><h2 id=picking-a-cla><a class=heading-anchor href=#picking-a-cla>##
</a>Picking a CLA</h2><p>Spending your weekend reading CLAs is a drag.</p><p>I decided to use <a href=http://www.harmonyagreements.org/>Harmony Agreements</a> to <a href=http://selector.harmonyagreements.org/>generate</a> the agreement. (I chose &ldquo;any license&rdquo; for the &ldquo;outbound license option&rdquo;.) The agreement it provides seems pretty good and pretty standard.</p><p>(Well&mldr; when I first generated a agreement I chose the &ldquo;copyright assignment&rdquo; version instead of &ldquo;copyright license&rdquo;. I even committed it and got the pull-request submitter to sign it. But then I re-read it and realized it was a) not very standard, b) maybe not enforceable, and c) kind of heinous. So I changed to the &ldquo;copyright license&rdquo; form. The difference is something like &ldquo;you&rsquo;re transferring absolute power to me and you lose the ability to use your own code&rdquo; versus &ldquo;you&rsquo;re letting me do whatever I want with your code but it&rsquo;s still yours&rdquo; &ndash; exclusive vs. non-exclusive license, kind of thing.)</p><h2 id=signing><a class=heading-anchor href=#signing>##
</a>&ldquo;Signing&rdquo;</h2><p>Ugh.</p><p>Some projects &ndash; like Apache &ndash; require you to print out the agreement, sign it, and mail, fax, or scan-and-email it back to them. Another one (I forget which) uses some Adobe e-signing plugin where you draw your signature on the screen. Google requires you to be signed in, but it&rsquo;s just a button press; ditto Twitter (signed in with Twitter, I mean). <a href=https://www.clahub.com/>CLAHub</a> requires a Github sign-in (with optional typing of &ldquo;I AGREE&rdquo;). I think I also saw some projects that just require a filled-in form.</p><p>CLAHub is really cool. It gives you a nice link for your CLA, collects agreements, and runs a bot that watches your project&rsquo;s PRs, checks against the CLAs, and comments on the PR as to whether the PR-user has agreed yet or not. Except&mldr; there&rsquo;s a notice saying it&rsquo;s not ready for prime-time, the bot is broken, and the blog hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a year. Also, entrusting a (flaky?) third party with the agreements seems dangerous (although they can be downloaded, so blah).</p><p>The article I linked above mentions &ldquo;some [projects] collect agreements through a simple web form (Google Doc is a fine choice)&rdquo;. So I created a Google Form with the CLA and a form for the contributor to provide contact info and indicate agreement. But&mldr;</p><p>Then I started thinking about non-repudiability. So I did a little reading about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature>electronic signatures</a> (not to be confused with digital signatures). Which is a horrible rabbit hole. Anyway, it made me seriously doubt that a row in a Google Spreadsheet with someone&rsquo;s maybe-correct address and the words &ldquo;I AGREE&rdquo; really constitutes a legal signature. (Even in the Google and Twitter cases &ndash; how would they prove that they didn&rsquo;t just fiddle some bits to make it look like I signed?)</p><p>And if you&rsquo;re going to do this annoying CLA crap then you might as well hope that it means something, right?</p><p>Then I found <a href=https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/sign-cla.md>Medium&rsquo;s open source project</a>. It requires contributors to commit a file along with their pull request stating that they agree to the CLA. That seemed&mldr; totally reasonable. The agreement is in-band with the code. In a way that I can&rsquo;t manipulate without invalidating. And much, much less annoying for the contributor than printing/signing/faxing.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s how I did it. See MDH&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement>CONTRIBUTING.md</a>. (That&rsquo;s the <a href=https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines>filename to use</a>.)</p><h2 id=backlash-warning><a class=heading-anchor href=#backlash-warning>##
</a>Backlash warning</h2><p>Doing the CLA read-and-agree dance is more effort than not doing it. And some people are offended at the idea of doing it (see the tweet at the top of the &ldquo;In Defense Of&rdquo; post.) So, it seems unavoidable that a project with a CLA will get fewer contributions than one without &ndash; some people just won&rsquo;t get past that hurdle.</p><p>But it still seems necessary.</p><hr><p>[Note: This is actually an email I wrote to my co-workers after going through this CLA exercise with Markdown Here. That&rsquo;s why the tone is a bit informal and &ldquo;blah&rdquo; is used as if it means something.]</p></article></div></section><hr><aside><p><h5>891 Words</h5></p><p>Last Update:

(And then I got schooled about that not being a problem.)
Security Feature: Smart Lock with Trusted Places Android&amp;rsquo;s Smart Lock allows users to configure conditions under which to keep the phone unlocked. One of the conditions is location &amp;ndash; you can set trusted locations where your phone shouldn&amp;rsquo;t prompt for a PIN/pattern/password when unlocking.</description></item></channel></rss>

## Jekyll

Instructions for running Jekyll locally, for testing the site: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/ ... Except the install fails on Cygwin, so just use `jekyll serve --watch` instead.

## TODO

* Pick better/more header fonts?
  - Erin thinks the pixel font is too pixel-y (especially since the background is as well).

* Main font seems too small on Macbook17. Make it bigger? Detect device something-something?

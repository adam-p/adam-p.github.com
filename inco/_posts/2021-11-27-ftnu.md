[From the Neck Up](https://fromtheneckupmassage.com/) does neck-up massage, including intra-oral. When the RMT has their fingers in your mouth it's pretty hard to give directions. So there are hand signs for communicating with the RMT. And, since you're laying on your back during the procedure, the guide to the signs are posted on the ceiling.
